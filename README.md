Overview
This project aims to delve into the world of stock market analysis, focusing on technology stocks.

Fetch Stock Data: Acquire historical stock price data for a selected group of technology companies from Yahoo Finance.
Data Cleaning and Exploration: Clean and preprocess the data to ensure its quality and suitability for analysis. Explore basic statistics, distributions, and correlations between different stock metrics.
Data Visualization: Create informative visualizations (e.g., line charts, histograms, scatter plots) to understand trends, patterns, and relationships within the stock data.
Risk Analysis: Calculate risk metrics like standard deviation, beta, and Sharpe ratio to assess the volatility and risk-adjusted returns of different stocks.
Price Prediction: Employ the Monte Carlo simulation method to generate probabilistic forecasts of future stock prices based on historical data and assumptions about future volatility.
Fetching Data from Yahoo Finance
To obtain stock price data from Yahoo Finance, we'll use the yfinance library in Python. Here's a basic example:


Key Analysis Steps
Data Cleaning: Handle missing values, outliers, and data inconsistencies.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Calculate summary statistics, visualize distributions, and identify correlations between variables.
Risk Metrics: Compute standard deviation, beta (relative risk to the market), and Sharpe ratio (risk-adjusted return).
Monte Carlo Simulation: Generate multiple simulated price paths based on historical volatility and assumptions about future returns.
Result Interpretation: Analyze the simulated price paths to assess potential future scenarios and associated risks.
By following these steps, we can gain valuable insights into the behavior of technology stocks, evaluate their risk profiles, and make informed investment decisions.
